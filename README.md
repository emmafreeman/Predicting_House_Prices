# Predicting House Sales Prices Using Advanced Regression Techniques

I used feature engineering and advanced regression techniques to build machine learning models to predict final home sales prices. The dataset I used consisted of 79 variables describing features of homes in Ames, Iowa.

This project was based on a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

I worked with the dataset using PostgreSQL and used Pandas for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning. 

From the scikit-learn library, I used PCA to explain the variance of the data and do dimensionality reduction. I used KMeans to cluster the data and KNeighborsClassifier to build a predictive model. I then built a series of grid-searched tree-based models to try to improve my predictive accuracy.

This was my second project for the Data Science Immersive prorgram at General Assembly.
